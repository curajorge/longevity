description: "Modify the active protocol based on feedback"
argument-hint: "<what to change — swap intervention, adjust dose, add biomarker>"
---

Find the most recently modified `.md` file in `protocols/`. That's the active protocol.

Read the active protocol file and `longevity-knowledge.md`.

Apply the user's requested changes directly to the file:
- Swap interventions → update mechanism, dose, and evidence level
- Change doses → recalculate and note rationale
- Add/remove biomarkers → update targets table
- Adjust time horizon → rewrite implementation timing
- Change category → ensure all interventions align

Update the file in place using the Edit tool. Do NOT rewrite the entire file — make targeted edits.

After editing, show the user a brief summary of what changed (not the full protocol unless they ask).
