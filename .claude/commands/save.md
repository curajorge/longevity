description: "Quick git save — add, commit, push"
---

Run in sequence:
1. `git add -A`
2. `git diff --cached --stat` — show what's being committed
3. `git commit` with message: `"longevity: brief summary of changes"`
4. `git push`

If nothing to save, say "Nothing to save."

Do not ask for confirmation — just do it.
