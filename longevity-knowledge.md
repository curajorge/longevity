# Longevity Science & Protocol R&D — Context Dump

High-signal reference for LLM-assisted protocol generation. Organized by category; each entry names the book, why it matters for longevity work, and the specific chapter-level topics to extract. Feed this into context before asking for protocols — it activates the model's deep knowledge of these sources and produces expert-caliber output instead of generic wellness advice.

## Key operational principles (across all categories)

1. **Exercise is the most potent longevity drug.** Nothing else in medicine — no supplement, no drug, no diet — has the effect size of moving from the bottom 25th percentile of VO2max to above the 75th percentile. That shift alone is associated with a 5x reduction in all-cause mortality (Attia, citing Mandsager et al.). Prioritize exercise above all other interventions.

2. **Insulin resistance is upstream of everything.** CVD, cancer, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disease all share hyperinsulinemia as a common driver. Fasting insulin <5 μIU/mL and HOMA-IR <1.0 are the targets. If you fix metabolic health, you reduce risk across all four horsemen simultaneously.

3. **Sleep is non-negotiable.** Every hour below 7 hrs/night increases all-cause mortality. Sleep deprivation impairs glucose metabolism (5 nights of 4 hrs → pre-diabetic levels), reduces natural killer cell activity by 70%, accelerates telomere shortening, and impairs glymphatic clearance of Alzheimer's-related proteins. No supplement stack compensates for broken sleep.

4. **ApoB, not LDL-C, is the causal particle.** LDL cholesterol is an imprecise proxy. ApoB directly measures the number of atherogenic particles. Target <60 mg/dL for high-risk individuals. Test annually. This is the highest-impact pharmacological intervention for preventing the #1 killer (CVD).

5. **Chronic stress accelerates biological aging through measurable pathways.** Cortisol → insulin resistance → visceral fat. Cortisol → hippocampal atrophy → cognitive decline. Cortisol → immune suppression → cancer surveillance failure. Cortisol → telomere shortening → cellular senescence. Manage stress with the same seriousness as diet and exercise.

6. **Distinguish evidence levels before recommending.** RCT in humans > large observational study > animal model > mechanistic plausibility > anecdote. Most longevity supplement claims are at the animal/mechanistic level. Be honest about this. Promising in mice ≠ proven in humans.

7. **Muscle mass is a longevity organ.** Sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) begins at 30 and accelerates after 60. Grip strength predicts all-cause mortality. Muscle is the primary glucose sink (80% of insulin-mediated glucose disposal). Strength training 3-4x/week with progressive overload is not optional after 30.

8. **Fasting works through nutrient-sensing pathways, not just caloric deficit.** The longevity benefit comes from activating AMPK and inhibiting mTOR/IGF-1 signaling — which triggers autophagy, mitophagy, and cellular repair. Time-restricted eating (8-12 hr window), periodic 24-36 hr fasts, or fasting-mimicking diets all achieve this. The mechanism matters more than the calories.

9. **Test, don't guess.** Biological age ≠ chronological age. DEXA for body composition, VO2max for cardiorespiratory fitness, OGTT with insulin for metabolic health, ApoB for cardiovascular risk, comprehensive blood panel annually. You can't optimize what you don't measure. Functional ranges are tighter than lab "normal" ranges.

10. **The hierarchy of interventions matters.** Exercise > sleep > nutrition > stress management > social connection > targeted supplementation > pharmacological geroprotectors. The foundational behaviors have the largest effect sizes. Don't optimize rapamycin dosing while sleeping 5 hours a night and being sedentary.
